<p className='text-justify font-poppins mb-4'>Welcome to  Ajarananada Blind Schoolâ€”a haven where the power of knowledge and spirituality intertwine to illuminate the lives of our students. Nestled within the serene embrace of our ashram, we embrace diversity and empower individuals who navigate the world with their unique perspective. Here, the absence of sight is not a barrier but a gateway to endless possibilities. With a blend of holistic education and spiritual guidance, we nurture minds, cultivate talents, and foster a sense of belonging. Welcome to a place where vision knows no bounds. 

Join us at our Blind School cum Ashram, where darkness is transformed into light, and every journey begins with the courage to see beyond the visible. Welcome to a place where the heart sees what the eyes cannot. Welcome home.</p>
