     In order to make the blind children self sufficient and independent to enable them to carve a proper place for themselves in the world for their future life, it was imperative to establish a school or a training centre to educate and train them in the varied streams. Our aim has always been to make them able to earn their livelihood and not to become a burden on others. Without educational and technical skills, our dream to shape the future of the blinds and the poor to was not possible to be accomplished. For spiritual development, the students are inspired to read the holy books like Ramayana, Geeta, Bhajans etc.
    <br />

    Some of our objectives are as follows:

    <br />
