              I am delighted to share information about the organization after
              nearly two decades. Despite my busy schedule, I've made an effort
              to provide insights into the organization's activities, including
              biographies of its founders and presidents. I am trying to compile
              important facts related to spiritual life, religious hymns, and
              teachings of saints and mahatmas, as well as practical insights
              for daily life. <br />The goal is to inform social workers, devotees,
              and other noble individuals about the organization's initiatives
              and action plans. By spreading awareness, it is hoped that
              individuals will contribute to the organization's self-reliance,
              aligning their efforts with positive and commendable endeavors.
              This effort is aimed at fostering a deeper understanding of the
              organization's mission and inspiring collective contributions
              toward its noble objectives.
